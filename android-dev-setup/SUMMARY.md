## Docker Support

Docker configuration files are provided for containerized development:

- `docker/Dockerfile`: Docker image definition
- `docker/docker-compose.yml`: Docker Compose configuration
- `docker/README.md`: Docker usage instructions

## CI/CD Integration

GitHub Actions workflow is provided for CI/CD integration:

- `github-actions-workflow.yml`: GitHub Actions workflow for building and testing Android apps

## Usage

To set up the complete Android development environment, run:

```bash
chmod +x /workspace/android-dev-setup/setup-all.sh
/workspace/android-dev-setup/setup-all.sh [INSTALL_DIR]
```

Where `[INSTALL_DIR]` is the directory where you want to install the Android development environment. If not specified, it defaults to `$HOME/android-dev`.

After installation, you need to activate the environment variables in your current shell:

```bash
source "$INSTALL_DIR/env-setup.sh"
```

## Validation

The setup includes validation steps to ensure everything is installed correctly. You can run the validation script manually:

```bash
chmod +x /workspace/android-dev-setup/validate-environment.sh
/workspace/android-dev-setup/validate-environment.sh [INSTALL_DIR]
```

## Docker Usage

To use the Docker container, run:

```bash
cd /workspace/android-dev-setup
docker build -t android-dev -f docker/Dockerfile .
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace android-dev
```
